# WFRP Group Advantage

A simple module to facilitate using the group advantage rules from the recently released Up in Arms supplement. 

First implementation is just a GM controlled resource tracker

## Future

Allow players to click on ally pool bringing up a dialog to spend points for actions (this will not automate bonuses or outcomes, just the spending)
Become smart enough to maybe automate some of the stuff


## Special Thanks
- Moo man - for the excellent system and some background images. I may have also taken a great amount of inspiration from his code on WnG
